# Ringtone Audio Files Required

To make the fake call feature work with realistic ringtone sounds, you need to add the following audio files to this directory:

1. ringtone.mp3 - Main ringtone sound (3-5 seconds loop)
2. beep.mp3 - Fallback beep sound (1-2 seconds)

## Recommended Ringtone Characteristics:
- Duration: 3-5 seconds (will loop automatically)
- Format: MP3
- Quality: 128kbps or higher
- Volume: Medium to high (not too loud)
- Style: Classic phone ringtone or modern notification sound

## Free Ringtone Sources:
- Freesound.org
- Zapsplat.com
- YouTube Audio Library
- System ringtones from your phone

## Alternative Implementation:
If you don't want to add audio files, the app will use:
- HapticFeedback.heavyImpact() as fallback
- System vibration patterns
- Visual animations for ringtone effect

The ringtone service is already implemented and will work with or without audio files.
